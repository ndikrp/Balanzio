# About The Project
An imbalance of nutrients, either through excess or deficiency, can lead to a range of diseases in our bodies. Therefore, maintaining a balanced nutrient intake is crucial for optimal health, growth, 
and organ function. This is why we created an app to help you track your daily nutrient consumption. Our app boasts features like a food scanner that reveals the calorie content of your food, 
a goal tracker to monitor your daily calorie intake, a recipe library to discover new dishes, a history log to recall your past meals, and a favorites section to personalize your experience. 
We hope this app empowers you to regulate and track your dietary nutrition effectively, promoting a healthier lifestyle.
